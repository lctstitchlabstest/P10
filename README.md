PHP
War is a card game involving two players.  The deck is divided evenly among the two players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card on his deck (a "battle"), and the player with the higher card takes both the cards played and moves them to the bottom of their stack. If the two cards played are of equal value, each player lays down three face-down cards and picks one of the cards out of the three (a "war"), and the higher-valued card wins all of the cards on the table, which are then added to the bottom of the player's stack. If one of the players has no more cards in a battle that player wins that battle. In the case of another tie, the war process is repeated until there is no tie.
A player wins by collecting all the cards. If a player runs out of cards while dealing the face-down cards of a war, they may play the last card in his deck as their face-up card and still have a chance to stay in the game.
Given these rules, define the classes you would implement to build a War simulator, which would log results for each game and each round of each game in a database.  The database must also catalog the winner of each round and the winner of each game.   Provide the following details of the system:
•         The SQL schema for the database.
•         The classes and the methods you would implement for the system.  You do not need to code the body of the class methods.  However, please code the framework in valid PHP code, and provide PHPDoc documentation for the classes and methods that include a 1-4 sentence explanation of the purpose of the class/method.  Your documentation should include proper documentation of variables, properties, author, versioning, etc.

JavaScript
Given an HTML unordered list of elements (<ul><li>element 1</li> … </ul>) in a web page, using only native JavaScript and the jQuery library (jQueryUI and any other libraries are not allowed), write a script that will allow a user to use drag and drop operations within the browser to reorder the list.  Please provide a single file to be loaded and tested using the Chrome browser.  This file should include the JavaScript Script, any CSS rules, and the HTML code necessary.  Please use the Google web resource for the most recent version of jQuery.
